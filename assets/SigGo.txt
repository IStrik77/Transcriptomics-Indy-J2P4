    germline gene segments encoding immunoglobulin superfamily domains. Recombined receptors for
    antigen encoded by immunoglobulin superfamily domains include T cell receptors and
    immunoglobulins (antibodies) produced by B cells. The first encounter with antigen elicits a
    primary immune response that is slow and not of great magnitude. T and B cells selected by
    antigen become activated and undergo clonal expansion. A fraction of antigen-reactive T and B
    cells become memory cells, whereas others differentiate into effector cells. The memory cells
    generated during the primary response enable a much faster and stronger secondary immune
    response upon subsequent exposures to the same antigen (immunological memory). An example of
    this is the adaptive immune response found in Mus musculus.

Ontology: BP
Definition: An intracellular signaling cassette characterized by the I-kappaB-kinase
    (IKK)-dependent activation of NF-kappaB, also known as the canonical NF-kappaB signaling
    cascade. The cascade begins with activation of a trimeric IKK complex (consisting of catalytic
    kinase subunits IKKalpha and/or IKKbeta, and the regulatory scaffold protein NEMO) and ends
    with the regulation of transcription of target genes by NF-kappaB. In a resting state,
    NF-kappaB dimers are bound to I-kappaB proteins, sequestering NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm.
    Phosphorylation of I-kappaB targets I-kappaB for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation,
    thus releasing the NF-kappaB dimers, which can translocate to the nucleus to bind DNA and
    regulate transcription. The canonical NF-kappaB pathway is mainly stimulated by
    proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, antigen
    ligands, and toll-like receptors (TLRs).
